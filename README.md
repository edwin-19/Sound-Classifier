# Sound classifier
Using torch audio to try and understand how to build a simple classifier to predict whether a sound is a cat or dog

# TODO
- [x] EDA for sound - generate melspectogram
- [x] Train with simple cnn
- [x] Evaluate Model
- [x] Augment Data
- [ ] Train with resnet50
- [ ] Train CRNN Model
- [ ] Add pytorch lighthing for sample usage
- [ ] Add torch lighthing datamodule

# Model Results
TBA
